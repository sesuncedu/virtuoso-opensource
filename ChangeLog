	Fixed issue with setps (oby, gby) and dfe dependency

	When placing a dfe record all the setps (oby,gby) between the use
	of the value and its computation, the dfe is added as a gby/oby
	dependent. When placing predicates that are imported into a dt and
	these contain subqs e.g. col = scalar subq where the scalar subq
	is independent of the dt being placed, then disable subq caching.
	If kept caching on but placed the subq before the dt the subq would
	be generated twice because renamed once when importing into the dt
